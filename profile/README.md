# zkAA: Zero-Knowledge Address Abstraction

Welcome to zkAA, an innovative project that abstracts address and signature protocols of blockchain,
facilitating seamless interaction across web2 and web3.

### Main Features
- **Zero-Knowledge Proofs**: Utilizes zk-SNARKs based on Groth16 and Plonk to ensure privacy and security in identity management.
- **Cross-Web and Cross-Chain Compatibility**: Enables web2 identities to interact across various blockchains.
- **Efficient Implementation**: Proven efficiency on Ethereum with low transaction costs, including support for aggregation (recursive) proofs based on Plonk.
